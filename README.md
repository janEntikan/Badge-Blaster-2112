Badge Blaster
=============

Made in one week for the PyWeek 31 challenge, themed "Cops".

Running from source
-------------------

Requires Python 3.7 or higher, and Panda3D 1.10.9 or higher.

To install the dependencies, use:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the game, use:
```
python main.py
```

Controls
--------

If a gamepad is detected, it is used instead of keyboard controls.
If you wish to use keyboard controls, you should therefore UNPLUG any gamepad first.

* Left/right arrow: move left/right
* Up arrow: use turbo
* Down arrow: slow down (useful for dodging bullets)

Edit keybindings.toml to alter the controls.
